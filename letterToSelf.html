    Dear ZacQuary,

    Sticking through Lambda School will be one of the most beneficial things 
    you do for yourself. If you can just put your head down and get through the 
    material, you'll be thanking yourself for years to come. You were learning
    on the side here and there and the structure of the school is just what 
    you need. Stick with it and before you know it you'll be landing your first
    software engineering position. You'll have great pay, great flexibility
    on hours worked, and great benefits that come along with the job. The 
    industry is growing and will continue to do so, so it'd be beneficial to
    stick through the school and power through it. You need this for your life
    to take the next step.
